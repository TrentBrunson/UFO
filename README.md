# UFO
   
### Overview  
--- 
Requestor provided a database of reported UFO sitings.  Built a front end with HTML, CSS & JavaScript to allow users to have a dynamic filter to select data from the dataset.  Converted all input cases to match lowercase database strings.

Requestor asked for if-else statements.  Including else in JS broke the logic of the multi-filter selections.  Returned results needed AND logic for the conditions.  If-else sequenced through the filter and will stop at the first returned value.

### Future Recommendations
---  
To use the filter correctly, a user needs to know the exact text.  Future revisions will update the search fields to a list of values in that column.  Also adding a duration and/or a comments search could be useful updates.
